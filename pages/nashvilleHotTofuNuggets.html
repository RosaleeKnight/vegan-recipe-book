            <ol>
                <li>First, you need to press the tofu. You can either use a tofu press, or place the tofu on a plate,
                    and put something heavy on top. Press for at least 30 minutes, but the longer the better, and you
                    can even do it over night. ⠀</li>
                <li>Once you are ready to make the tofu nuggets, preheat the oven to 375 degrees. ⠀</li>
                <li>Now, cut the block of tofu into cubes. Set aside. ⠀</li>
                <li>Then take 3 medium/smallish mixing bowls. In the first bowl, whisk together the almond milk, apple
                    cider vinegar and the 1 tsp. of hot sauce. In the second bowl, whisk together the flour and the 1
                    tsp. of salt. In the third bowl, add the panko. ⠀</li>
                <li>Now, taking a few cubes of tofu at a time, toss them in the flour, shake off excess, now put them
                    into the almond milk mixture, make sure they are totally soaked, then back into the flour then back
                    into the almond milk, then into the panko coating completely. Pat the panko on to the tofu to make
                    sure it is fully coated. ⠀</li>
                <li>Repeat with all the tofu cubes, placing them on a baking sheet sprayed with non stick spray, until
                    all the tofu is coated. Then bake at 375 degrees for 25-30 minutes flipping them halfway through
                    baking, or until they are brown and crunchy. ⠀</li>
                <li>While the tofu is baking, make the sauce. In a small sauce pan, melt the vegan butter and olive oil
                    together on medium low. Then whisk in the 2 Tbsp. of hot sauce, agave, paprika, garlic powder, and
                    the 1/2 tsp. of salt. Let simmer for a minute, then turn the heat off.⠀</li>
                <li>Once the tofu is done, toss the nuggets in the sauce and serve immediately! Enjoy! </li>
