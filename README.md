  # 🖱️ Vegan Recipe Website
  Collection of vegan recipes from different locations. This is version 5 which is hosted on both Replit and Github. In this project I created a responsive website using bootstrap that scales with different size screens and has a auto detected mobile mode. The website itself has a static menu bar on the top with links to section headings, a description with a scalable picture that disappears on mobile, cards for each section, an accordion for frequently asked questions and a footer with a button to take you to the top. Each section page follow the same format with each card instead containing the picture of the recipe, the name and the link to the page. Each recipe follows the same format however there is only one card with the recipe which has the picture, ingredients, instructions and a link to the source. All pictures and accordions are accessability friendly with tags for screen readers.  
  
  Work In Progress.
